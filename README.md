### README for Steiner Cafe Website

#### Introduction
Welcome to the Steiner Cafe website project! This Django-based website is designed to provide an online presence for the Steiner Cafe, showcasing our menu, location, and unique coffee culture. Developed with Django and Bootstrap, it's structured for easy navigation and a beautiful user experience.

#### Prerequisites
Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django (The version used in this project. If not specified, the latest version is recommended.)
- Other dependencies (If your project uses other libraries, they should be installed separately. This guide assumes Django is the primary dependency.)

#### Setting Up Locally
To get the Steiner Cafe website running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project** (Assuming the project is hosted on a repository; otherwise, ensure you have the project files on your machine.)

2. **Install Dependencies**  
Since a `requirements.txt` file was not detected, install Django using pip (Python's package installer):
   ```
   pip install django
   ```
   Replace `django` with the exact version if necessary, and install any other required packages similarly.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   Open a terminal or command prompt, and navigate to the project's root directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/mysite
   ```

4. **Migrate the Database**
   Before running the server, apply migrations to set up your database schema:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**
   Start the Django development server with the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   This will start the server on the default port 8000. You can access the website by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser.

6. **Explore the Website**
   Navigate through the website to explore its features. You can interact with the site as a visitor or perform administrative tasks in the Django admin interface (if an admin user has been set up).

#### Additional Information
- **Creating an Admin User**
  If you need to create an admin user to manage the site via Django's admin interface, run the following command and follow the prompts:
  ```
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
- **Dependencies**
  This guide assumes Django is the primary dependency. If your project uses other external libraries, please ensure they are installed via pip or included in a `requirements.txt` file for easier setup.

#### Support
For any questions or issues setting up the project locally, please reach out to the project maintainers or consult the Django documentation for more detailed instructions on working with Django projects.
